            <li>
                Select your instance and click on the "Mods" button, then

            <li>

                Download the shader you want to use from the internet. In the
                main menu, click on "Files".

                Note: You can also do this with Optifine, but it's less
                recommended. Instead of installing Fabric and those mods, just
                install Optifine.

        <h2>How do I change skins?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use the customskinloader mod. Go to "Mods" and if you haven't

            How do I change the icon/create a shortcut of the launcher on Linux?
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create a quantumlauncher.desktop file. Type in the following
                thing:

                <pre>
                    <code>
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Terminal=false
Exec=/path/to/quantum_launcher
Name=QuantumLauncher
Icon=/path/to/icon.ico
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the path to the quantum_launcher executable to the Exec
                field.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you want an icon, download one from
                https://mrmayman.github.io/quantumlauncher/favicon.ico and add
                it's path to the Icon field, otherwise remove that line.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you want to see the debug output of the launcher, change
                Terminal to true.

                Try allowing Minecraft through firewall. Here's a
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn2BJ9jLYNs">video</a> on how to do it.
                And if you're playing Minecraft on a private server also
                try telling the host to do the same.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make sure you have a stable internet connection.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are using a VPN, try disabling it. If you are using a
                firewall, make sure the launcher is allowed to connect to the
                internet. If you are using a proxy, make sure the launcher is configured
                to use it.

        <h2>Invalid Session</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                This means that the server needs a paid Minecraft account.
                If you know the host, you can tell them to open server.properties
                file and set online-mode to false.
            </li>
            <li>
                (WARNING: Doing this will make the server vulnerable to hackers,
                maybe consider adding some kind of login mod and whitelist to the server too)
